# Text-Based Game Challenge

#### Overview

Text-based games, or interactive fiction games, are one of the earliest styles of computer games. Text-based games create a narrative where the user is presented with a series of choices. Each decision the user makes moves the game forward in a unique way. Creating a text-based game requires a developer to create organized code that will trigger further code actions in response to the user's decision.

#### Learning Objectives

- can demonstrate effectively collecting user interactions from the IRB console
- can determine appropriate built-in Ruby methods needed to accomplish a task

#### Process

- clone the appropriate repository from GitHub classroom
- `cd` into the repository
- Create a new branch for each feature you implement
- Open the folder in a text editor
- Code!

### Planning

The most important part of this project is the planning phase. Work with your team to construct a story line. Think of an idea that will make your game enjoyable. Common choices are treasure hunts, day-in-the-life stories, zombie apocalypse adventures, and murder mysteries.

You need to decide how your user will interact with the code that you write. Every option you present will need to be followed with an action. If you choose to create multiple storylines your code base will need to reflect all the possible actions. Each storyline can be a unique adventure where some are successful and some are not.

### Game Play

The game will take place entirely in the terminal. All interactions between the user and the game are text-based. The user will see a story printed to the terminal and then be presented with options that the will determine the next phase of the story. The user will type their selection into the terminal.

### Tips and Tricks

Think about how the user will contribute to the game. Whatever the user does will need to trigger the next step. This means as the game creator you must present your options in a easily accessible way. Options include presenting the user with yes or no choices, giving the user a numbered list of options, or prompting the user to type specific words. Keep in mind that the casing and spacing of your user's response will affect the functionality of your code.

The Ruby `gets` operator is your best friend in this game. Calling the method `.chomp` on the `gets` operator will remove the `return` keystroke syntax. The `gets` operator will always return a string. It is the developer's responsibility to change the data type if necessary.

Think about the difference between `p` and `puts`. Using `p` in development is helpful for seeing raw data outputs in the terminal. But you may not want code syntax such as quotation marks in your text-based stories.

Keep your code simple. You have all the tools you need to effectively construct the game. This is an exercise in organization, planning, and creativity.

Have fun! This medium is prime for easter eggs and (class appropriate) inside jokes.

 Anthony Mackie walks into a restaurant and wants to order something for his anniversary. He's heard great things about the rack of lamb and baked raspberry cheesecake and has high hopes because Gordon Ramsay oversees the operation. You're a chef in training under Gordon Ramsay and you are ordered by him to make these dishes and not become an idiot sandwhich. You have all of the required ingredients, it is your job to not f*** it up, buddy. No pressure, its just Anothony Mackies anniversary.
 You've been given salt and pepper, olive oil, cloves, garlic mince, dried thyme, dried rosemary, dijon mustard, honey. Gordon Ramsay asks, "whats the first step?" 
 option one: Preheat the oven to 400°F 
 option two: Preheat the oven to 240°F 
 option three: Preheat the oven to 150°F 




dish 1: 2 racks of lamb, each with 8 ribs
Ingredient list 1:
Salt and pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried rosemary
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp honey

Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Season the racks of lamb with salt and pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the lamb to the skillet and sear on all sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Remove the lamb from the skillet and set aside.
In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, thyme, rosemary, Dijon mustard, and honey.
Brush the mixture over the top and sides of the lamb racks.
Return the lamb to the skillet and roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 135°F (57°C) for medium-rare.
Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.



dish 2: Cream cheese 500 g
Sugar 200 g
3 eggs
Flour 3 tablespoons
Raspberries 300 g
Butter 30 g

Take cold cream cheese and add some sugar in it. Mix the sugar with cream cheese. Then, give the mixture a good whisk.
Whisk 3 eggs. Add whisked eggs to the cream cheese bit by bit.
Add a couple of tablespoons of flour. Whisk.
For freshness add lemon zest.
Fold in some fresh raspberries. Mix, but be careful to crush the raspberries.
Grease the cake tin with butter.
Place the dough in to the cake tin.
Place it into the oven for 180C for 35-40 minutes
